# Ensemble-Learning

Mostly used ensemble techniques:

<h2>Voting </h2>
<h2>Bagging </h2>
<h2>Boosting </h2>
<h2>Stacking </h2>


<h4>Bagging vs RandomForest</h4>
<h4>-> Bagging technique can be used with DT or KNN or SVM as base estimators 
whereas Random Forest contains only DT as base estimators. <br>
-> Sampling happens at model level in bagging whereas it is done at node level 
in case of RF</h4>
